      The three semantic tags that must be on every page you create 
      are header, main, and footer.

      Most semantic tags are containers. They need ACTUAL HTML elements inside them.
      Just putting text inside a footer without a p tag or h2 tag is not acceptable.
      The exception is figcaption.

          <h2>What is Classic Rock?</h2>
          <p>
            "<span id="definition">Classic rock</span> is a US radio format
            which developed from the album-oriented rock (AOR) format in the
            early 1980s. In the United States, the classic rock format comprises
            rock music ranging generally from the mid-1960s through the mid
            1990s, primarily focusing on commercially successful blues rock and
            hard rock popularized in the 1970s AOR format."
