          <h2>What is Classic Rock?</h2>
          <p>
            "<span id="definition">Classic rock</span> is a US radio format
            which developed from the album-oriented rock (AOR) format in the
            early 1980s. In the United States, the classic rock format comprises
            rock music ranging generally from the mid-1960s through the mid
            1990s, primarily focusing on commercially successful blues rock and
            hard rock popularized in the 1970s AOR format."

          <h2>What are the Characteristics of Classic Rock?</h2>
          <p>
            "If we are to define classic rock by sound alone, then there are
            some key characteristics. Tracks that fall into this category will
            often be guitar-led, with a fairly simple chord progression and
            influenced by rhythm and blues in its purest form. The idea of these
            tracks being deemed 'classic' is supported by how enduringly
            successful they are. Take the Eagles, whose album Their Greatest
            Hits (1971-1975) became America's best-selling album of all time in
            2018 after being certified 38-times platinum."
